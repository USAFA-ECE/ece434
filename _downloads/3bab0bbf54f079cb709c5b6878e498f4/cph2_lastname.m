function samples = cph2_lastname(fo,fs,A,C)
% samples = cph2_lastname(fo,fs,A,C) 
%     Purpose: returns "samples", an array of a cosine of frequency fo, 
%     sampled at fs, and lasting C cycles.
%
%     Inputs
%       fo   Frequency of sinusoid to sample
%       fs   Sample Frequency
%       A    Amplitude of sinusoid
%       C    Number of cycles of sampled sinusoid to create.
%            
%     Output 
%       Samples  Array containing the samples of the sinusoid
