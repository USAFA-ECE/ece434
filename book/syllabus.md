- Demonstrate an ability to analyze discrete-time signals and systems.

- Design basic discrete-time systems implemented in both hardware and software.

- Use computer-based tools for analysis and synthesis of discrete-time signals and systems.

- Frame and resolve well-defined and ill-defined problems related to DSP topics. 

- Present to an audience in a professional manner well-organized and thoughtful oral or written solutions to various DSP problems, projects, and/or overviews of current DSP topics


## Course Prerequisites
- The student must have satisfactorily completed ECE 333 or have permission from the ECE 434 Course Director.


## Grade Distribution and Policy

The **Grade distribution** for this course is shown below.


| Category                          | Prog | Final |
|-----------------------------------|------|-------|
| GR 1                              | 40%  | 20%   |
| GR 2                              |      | 20%   |
| Computer Exercises (CPX1 & 2)     | 20%  | 15%   |
| Final Project (CPX3)              |      | 25%   |
| Homework (CPH)                    | 20%  | 15%   |
| Quizzes / Skills Dev-Review       | 20%  | 5%    |
| **Total**                         | 100% | 100%  |


<br>

This course no longer has a final exam.  The 3rd CPX serves as the final project.
<br>
Some computer homework problems (CPH) and all computer exercises (CPX) will use MATLAB; they are designed to help you develop an intuitive understanding of digital signal processing.

<br>
The CPHs are due approximately every other lesson.  The CPH assignment will be posted on the ECE 434 blackboard website. Most assignments (including MATLAB code) will be turned in via blackboard and are due 0800 the day of class in the format requested. Your computer being down is not an excuse for failing to turn in the assignment.  Find alternative methods (e.g., other computers).  If you have a problem submitting the CPH, then send your answers to your instructor via e-mail.
<br>
Each CPX will result in a short report in a format to be specified during the semester, turned in (with your MATLAB code) via e-mail. While these reports will not require extensive writing, they will be graded both on language and technical content.  (The emphasis will be on understanding of DSP principles, MATLAB coding results, and clear communication of ideas.)  CPX3 will be a group project and will include a group presentation.  
<br>
All quizzes, GRs, and the final exam in this class will be closed book. You will be able to use the 434 equation sheet.
<br>


## Late Work Policy
- CPH’s must be turned in on time (else a zero if late).  All CPH assignments are due 0800 the day of class. For some flexibility for extenuating circumstances, your lowest CPH grade will be dropped at prog, and the 2nd lowest for the final grade.
- Late turn-in penalties for all other assignments are:
<ul><li>10%	if by taps on the day it is due </li><li> 25%	for the first calendar day</li><li> 50%	for the second calendar day</li><li> 75%	for the third calendar day</li><li> 100%	for four or more calendar day (at this point you get a 0).</li></ul> 
<br>
- If notified in advance, an instructor can make individual exceptions to this policy or possibly grant extensions.
<br>
- Regarding extensions on the CPXs and final project: The schedule for the due dates for these projects is published lesson 1.  Do not expect any extensions.  For example, if going on a trip the week an assignment is due, you are expected to turn it in BEFORE you leave… schedule your time appropriately.
- All CPX assignments must be turned in – even if more than 4 days late – to avoid a possible course grade of incomplete. 


## Grading Scale
Electrical and Computer Engineering courses are contract graded using the following 100 point scale.
<br>

|     Grade       |     Grade      |     Grade       |     Grade     |   
|:---------------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|
| 93 <= A <= 100  | 87 <= B+ < 90  | 77 <= C+ < 80   | 60 <= D < 70  | 
| 90 <= A- < 93   | 83 <= B < 87   | 73 <= C < 77    | 0 <= F < 60   | 
|                 | 80 <= B- < 83  | 70 <= C- < 73   |               |


## Textbooks
**Required:**
By lesson 1, each student must have their own copy of:

- Digital Signal Processing, A Practical Approach, 2nd Ed, E. Ifeachor and B. Jervis, Prentice Hall, 2002.
 
## Required Software

In addition to the text, each student must have their own copy of and be familiar with the following software:

- MATLAB, 2014a or later
- Filter Design Toolbox

You cannot work through many of the ECE 434 assignments if you don't have this software!  

## Extra Instruction (EI)

If you've read the material, attempted the problems, asked your classmates for help, yet still have difficulty understanding the concepts, seek EI from an ECE434 professor. Make an appointment via e-mail (or the booking app), with a description of your difficulties. Be prepared during EI to intelligently discuss your difficulties and your attempts to overcome them. Note: EI is not a time to “catch-up” on something you missed through inattention or an absence.

## CAS Policy

If at all possible, absences must be coordinated ahead of time.  Be sure to check your
SCA to see if instructor “Notification” or “Permission” is required.  There is a difference!
If it’s “permission” you need, be sure to ask as soon as you know you need it.  Email or Teams
is the preferred method of communication for CAS.  Be sure to include the lesson
number along with the reason for your absence.  

## Collaboration Policy and Generative AI Policy

- Use of Generative AI (like ChatGPT) is prohibited for this class, except for specific assignments where it is allowed by your instructor.

- To solve homework (CPH), the only authorized resource is your textbook and other class notes provided on the course Blackboard or Team’s site. You may work with any other cadet. For CPHs requiring MATLAB, the only additional online source you are allowed to use is the MathWorks website.

- The skills review and the first two computer exercises (CPX) are individual effort. For CPXs, the only online source you are allowed to use is the MathWorks website. See Academics With Honor and the individual assignments for further guidance. 

- As always, you may not simply copy another person's assignment – the actual item turned-in must be your own work.  To receive academic credit, you should be able to explain how any of the code you turn in works.  

- For all assignments you must document any help you receive.  If you receive no assistance on an exercise, the use of the Documentation: None statement is mandatory.

## Graded Evaluations  
- These include the quizzes and the GRs.  Primary sources for questions include the textbook, information presented in class, handouts, and homework problems.

- You must notify your instructor one lesson in advance to schedule a make-up if you anticipate missing any scheduled graded evaluation or assigment turn-in.  Schedule makeup exams or extension beforehand!

-  The course equation sheet will  be provided on the GRs:  [Equation Sheet](handouts/Equation_Sheet_434.pdf)



## Course Overview

The course schedule is [here](schedule.md). This course covers material which will prepare you to deal competently with the ever-increasing prevalence of digital signals, digital systems, and digital signal processing (DSP). The emphasis in ECE 434 is on fundamental principles and practical applications, rather than esoteric theory or arcane derivations.
<br>
For the student who wishes to specialize in DSP or image processing; these are two very hot fields both in and out of the Air Force today and in the foreseeable future.  ECE 434 lays the foundation for those more in-depth DSP and image processing courses you'll need to take later in graduate school.

## Professional Engineer

Now that most of you are seniors in an ECE major, we expect you to turn in assignments in a professional manner expected of engineers. For example, when you turn in a plot, it should have a proper title and the axis’ should have proper labels with proper units, etc.

## ECE434 should be fun!

DSP can be an enjoyable topic in ECE, if you put forth a reasonable amount of effort. By using MATLAB, many aspects of discrete-time systems and DSP can be explored without the drudgery of the past (when we had to program everything in FORTRAN, C, or assembly language).  Therefore, MATLAB is emphasized heavily in this course. 
<br>
If you are rusty or lack confidence using MATLAB, practice now (see examples in your text book); there won't be time later in the semester.  Similarly, if you're not comfortable with some of the basic ECE topics such as Fourier transforms, Laplace transforms, impulse response, transfer functions, convolution, etc., review these topics now; we won't have time to re-teach them in depth in ECE 434. These topics will be part of the Skills Review assignment.

## ECE434 and Other Courses

For those of you who are also taking ECE 447 this semester, we have made every effort to coordinate the two courses so that the sequence of topics and graded events complement, rather than compete with, each other.
<br>
Because digital communications rely heavily on DSP, and nearly all military and civilian communications (ground, airborne, and satellite) are or will soon be digital, it is important that these two courses are synergistic. DSP is also used in many other areas such as music recording, image processing, simulations, speech recognition, radar, sonar, geophysics, oceanography, and astrophysics.  It's also used in equipment such as CD players, DVD players, digital tuners, satellite TV, cellular phones, as well as most of the special effects you see and hear in movies.
<br>
Thus, learning about the basics of discrete-time systems and DSP will help all electrical and computer engineers.  This course, ECE 434, is your opportunity to find out about it!

Finally, here are some quotes that convey some thoughts that may guide you to success throughout your career in the Air Force and beyond.  I hope they inspire you in a positive manner:

- *There comes a time in every man's life when he is called upon to do something very special for which he and he alone has the capabilities, has the skills, and has the necessary training. What a pity if the moment finds the man unprepared.*           --- Winston Churchill

- *That which does not kill us makes us stronger.*        --- Friedrich Nietzsche

- *No one said it would be easy, But no one said it would be this hard… and no one thought we’d come this far.*        --- Sheryl Crow
